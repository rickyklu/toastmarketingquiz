# Toast Marketing Front End Web Developer

The goal of this case study is to create a web page that displays this week's weather, using [Dark Sky's](https://darksky.net/dev) API.

This should be made using Node and Express(or similar), with a front end templating language for dynamic assets. Twig is preferred, but EJS/Jade/Handlebars/etc also works.

Please clone (don't fork) this repo to get started, and send us a link to your repo when finished.

Final project should be sent as a github repo, and a github.io or similar live page.
