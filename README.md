# Toast Marketing Front End Web Developer (Attempt by Ricky Lu)

The goal of this case study is to create a web page that displays this week's weather, using [Dark Sky's](https://darksky.net/dev) API.

This should be made using Node and Express(or similar), with a front end templating language for dynamic assets. Twig is preferred, but EJS/Jade/Handlebars/etc also works.

Please clone (don't fork) this repo to get started, and send us a link to your repo when finished.

Final project should be sent as a github repo, and a github.io or similar live page.

## Requirments

- Set up:

1.  Styling must be written in Sass/SCSS, and use a compiler such as Gulp to pipe to CSS.
1.  ES6 syntax in development.

- API Requirements

  1.  API key must not be exposed on the page
  1.  User should be able to enter a zip code and get weather results.

- Page requirements:

  1.  Site must be mobile responsive.
  1.  Javascript on the page should follow cross-browser compatibility best practices

- Bonus

  1.  Use an IP Lookup or similar to initially load the weather of the visitor's location.
  1.  Use React or Vue components on the page.
  1.  The forecast should have personalized icons based on the result (Sunny day shows sunny icon for example).
  1.  How can the page be best optimized for SEO from a front-end perspective?
  1.  Any extra flair or features you like!

If you get stuck along the way, feel free to move forward to the next part. Include any notes on where you stopped, and any details in an email along with submission.

## Development Usage

- `npm run dev`: runs react front end (created by create-react-app) and express backend
- `keys.js`: a key file to determine which keys to use
- To use for your own development, create a `dev.js`, file with javascript object containing the propprietary key
